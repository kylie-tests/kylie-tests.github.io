# Exercise

For a strong portfolio piece, you want to be able to demonstrate that you can:

1. Propose an interesting, coherent character that fits your gameâ€™s genre conventions while offering something new(ish) and executable
2. Account for the fact they are a video game character and show awareness of the mediumâ€™s requirements as well as what is technologically possible in the type of game youâ€™re writing for
3. Convey relevant information about a character to other members of the gameâ€™s team in a way that is thorough without being restrictive

# Instructions

We suggest you begin by picking a target genre of game. Choose a genre thatâ€™s in line with the games made by the studio(s) youâ€™d like to work at, but donâ€™t pick an actual game to try and write for as we want this to work as a general portfolio piece.

With your genre conventions in mind, brainstorm your concept and read over some of the materials about character creation.

When youâ€™re ready, take a look at this document template: Â [PWW - Character Design Template.docx](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/730132/attachments/251/158/239/PWW_-_Character_Design_Template.docx)

- Make a copy of the template to fill out in your version of the document
- Your character can be a Playable Character, NPC, Ally, Party Member, or Enemy for your game
- Rename the document so your name appears in it
- Remove the content in regular brackets and square brackets
- Ensure your finished design document isÂ **2 pages maximum**

**Examples of personality traits**: Â Resourceful, Loud Mouth, Cunning, Self-Centered, Airhead

**Examples of character summaries:**Â For FC5's Boomer the Dog: The Good Boy. For FC5's Grace Armstrong (Army Sniper): The Sharpshooting Hero

A part of the exercise here will be identifying what information is necessary for your specific document. Feel free to remove irrelevant fields. If you think of something else, you can add it, and be prepared to discuss it.

Video game characters are often designed through hours and hours of meetings between different teams on a project. For now, youâ€™ll be writing up and designing your character on your own, so donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions for quick feedback in Slack (**#character-design**), or voice your ideas to your friends to see how they might react to your choices. Being able to incorporate the feedback of others is an invaluable skill when writing as part of a team.

**Be aware!** Watch out for harmful stereotypes, especially when building from archetypes.

Consider your audience and their cultural background and demographic. What tropes are they familiar with, to their delight, boredom, or dismay?
