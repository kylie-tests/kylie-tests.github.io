# Discussion questions

If you are following this material with a group, feel free to use some of these discussion question to launch into deeper discussions on the material. If you’re following the material alone take the time and think about how you would answer the questions for yourself.

1. Things can change quickly in game writing, especially in an AAA environment. Asking questions about how and why you’ve made certain creative decisions is key to staying flexible and being able to change direction rapidly. Whether you feel stuck or confident in your document so far, here are some things to think about:
2. If the character you’re designing were in a different category (Playable Character, NPC, Party Member, etc), how would their design change, if at all? Similarly, if your game type changed (RPG, FPS, MMO, platformer, etc), how would their design change?
3. How would you have approached this document differently if, instead of picking a character to write, you were assigned one? ...and that character happened to be of an archetype or profession or background that you’re unfamiliar with, and/or which you find boring?
4. How does the assumed cultural background of your audience shape how this character will be received? If suddenly your game was only for release in North America, or Europe, or China, would your design need to change for the character to have the same resonance? Who have you been writing for all along?
5. Does your character do anything to subvert tropes or turn player expectations on their head? (For example, does your gruff military captain have a soft spot for knitting?) Have you made sure they’re not “one note”?
6. Imagine you have to hand off your character to another writer someday. Do they have enough to play with, without getting bogged down in the details?
7. Is your document written in a way that’s informative, and that’ll get your team invested in your character? Aaron Linde’s [character sheet for Marquis](https://twitter.com/aaronlinde/status/1353402930049675267?s=20), written as a writing test for Gearbox, is an example of what I mean. The key information is all there, but it’s also entertaining in and of itself. This can go a long way in making sure a big team remembers, and invests in, the details.
