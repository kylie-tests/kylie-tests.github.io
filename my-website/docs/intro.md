# Pixelles Game Writing Curriculum

## About this curriculum

Over the years Pixelles has hosted both in-person writers groups and online programs to go over this content and teach writers the basics of writing for video games. Due to the huge increase in interest we’re making our curriculum open to the public so that anyone can browse our lesson plans, take them to start their own writers groups, or refer to whenever they need a refresher.

> This collection of material is the work of multiple Pixelles volunteers. If you are using our content to build out your own lesson plan, especially in a professional environment, consider giving a [donation to Pixelles](https://ko-fi.com/pixelles) so that we can keep content like this available for free.
> 

The goal of this content is to provide introductions to some of the basic writing types unique to video games. Each chapter covers one of these topics, provides further resources through links to other public sources as well as exercises we’ve crafted to put what you learn into practice.

Lots of our material links to YouTube talks, written articles, or even posts from industry writers. Due to the nature of the internet we can’t promise that these links will work forever. If you find any broken URLs, you can notify us at writersgroup@pixelles.ca.

## Writing for video games

So, just what is narrative, and what is its role in games? Narrative is used most commonly to describe not just the plot or story (a defined, linear sequence of events that unfold with causality), but all of the elements that contribute to supporting the plot, and/or the environment in which a story takes place. In games, narrative often refers to a department, which may include only writers, or which may have other roles such as narrative designers. As games evolve, these terms can still be in flux and differ between studios, but a great explanation of the job titles and responsibilities can be found [here](https://wildwinter.medium.com/role-functions-in-game-narrative-9d4b4daace3b).

Modern AAA games put a lot of effort into their story. It’s now expected that video games have storylines to compete with blockbuster movies and television shows that run for five seasons. Now AAA studios have large teams of writers working on anything from 60-hour story arcs to endless NPC barks, item descriptions, world lore, character creation, and more. There are also games that use procedural narratives, in which puzzle pieces of story (of sizes from individual characters to whole scenes and arcs) come together to create a unique experience for every single player; writing these is a very different beast!

Game writing is usually a team activity. Rarely is there one writer working alone. But regardless of team size, writers are constantly in communication with other departments to ensure the story they want to tell is going to work. The story needs to make sense with the gameplay and the gameplay needs to be executed by the programmers and level/quest designers. Neither of these facets of a game can be developed without knowledge of the other.

As you can see, there is a lot to learn about game writing, and much of it relevant only to specific situations you may or may not encounter.

This program isn’t large enough to go through everything, unfortunately. This program focuses on some of the core building blocks of game writing that can serve you in writing games of any size and budget.
