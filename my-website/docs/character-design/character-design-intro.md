# Intro to character design

Mario. Master Chief. Pikachu. Geralt of Rivia. Link. Lara Croft. Sephiroth. Your chosen party in Baldur's Gate 3.

Characters can be one of the most iconic visual elements of a game, and getting to know these characters more deeply can be the most enticing reason why players spend hundreds of hours playing. Characters can also be a crucial way to deliver new gameplay and story in games without single-player campaigns. However they’re used, there’s no arguing that characters are critically important to video games.

Character design documents are how the narrative team establishes the essential elements of a character. This document helps the narrative team write a character consistently across writers, and it is also how they share the character’s direction with the other departments involved in the character’s creation.

Accordingly, the character design document must contain information to help several departments do their jobs: gameplay, visuals, and audio, on top of key reference points for the narrative team. Like anything shared across departments, it must be concise and easy to read.

For this unit, you’ll be making your own!

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this module you should be able to:

- Understand the purpose of a character design document
- Recognize how the character design document’s purpose impacts its format
- Understand the use of character archetypes in the character design document
- Combine archetypes with observation and gameplay needs to make a unique character
- Create a complete character design document
- Begin thinking deeply about character creation itself

## Time

This assignment should take roughly 8 hours or less, including the time spent at your computer and the time spent thinking about your character. It will involve more thinking time than writing time. We suggest you use the first 4 hours to make your big decisions and make a first draft, and the final 4 to go over the final details.
