# Lesson

This is a good place to start if character creation is brand new to you: Pixelles alumna and Ubisoft writer Linda Nguyen created a PowerPoint presentation about character creation and archetypes. You can find the [presentation here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rRxXarjFpmXsZqf_FqDD5STpE0RmhKbm/view?usp=sharing).

Archetypes are especially important in video games because every character must serve a purpose. Archetypes can help writers quickly understand how a character will act, what the audience might expect of them, and how they function within the plot–and therefore, the game as a whole.

The (in)famous TV Tropes has an enormous breadth of reading to do on [character tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Characters), and can be useful to check if something is a recognized trope.

Tropes, archetypes, and pointing to existing characters as reference are helpful for early brainstorming and fitting a character into your world; they are known, familiar. They can also be helpful when communicating ideas to the development team quickly.

But what really helps to make a character feel special is to add something new on the familiar. You should consider adding a twist: a surprising, or even counterintuitive characteristic that gives new life to the trope. Consider mixing and matching different tropes and see what jumps out to you. Archetypes and tropes are just ingredients, but you are the chef.

# **Beyond Archetypes & the Document**

As you know, creating a character isn’t as simple as filling out a document. Learning how to craft engaging characters audiences care about is a career-long task, unfortunately beyond the scope of this course! But for those who would like some guideposts to begin that journey, consider the following.

In addition to studying characters as fictional constructs through archetypes and tropes, writers keep their eyes open to the world and people around them. While putting someone you know wholesale into a game will raise ethical and legal considerations, writers across time have let themselves be inspired by real people they know and situations surrounding them. Often our best inspiration and reference is our own lived experience.

(Did you know that Kirby is named after attorney John Kirby, who helped Nintendo win a legal battle that secured the future of the company?)

TTRPGs (table-top role-playing games) are a great place to experience and practice character creation if it’s brand new to you. If you have the opportunity to join a game (sites like roll20.net let you find groups online), you might consider trying it out as part of refining your craft. By creating a character and playing over several sessions, you will improve your instincts about character group dynamics, negotiating different character personalities, role-filling, and long-term vs short-term (or deep/shallow) considerations for character backgrounds. It can also just be a ton of fun.

For your assignment, try working with this formula to get started:

Fiction (trope, archetype, existing character) **+** Life Example(s) (people you know; an isolated quirk or biographic detail) **+** Gameplay needs (Need a healer? A side kick?) **+** Plot needs (how do they influence the plot) **=** Your character

Don’t forget to keep your audience, and what appeals to them, in mind. You’ll want to craft a character that intrigues, delights, or even surprises them.
